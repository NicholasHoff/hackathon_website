## What is this hackathon?
The main idea is to gather 5-8 ML experts in Berlin, choose a research paper that we all thought was interesting, and then:
- implement the paper
- try out our ideas for extensions
- answer a question we had while reading
- apply the idea to a different domain

We dedicate one full weekend to the hackathon. Before meeting, we will have decided which paper to work from and which ideas to try out. Our default ML framework is pyTorch.

## Who should attend?
This hackathon is not suitable for beginners. Our time is limited so we don't cover any of the basics, even on the specific topic we're working on. Generally, you should be able to implement significant parts of a research paper, have new ideas about how to take the work forward, and be able to do that mostly on your own if you had the time.

We don't have strict criteria about who can attend, but generally you should:
- have an advanced degree in a relevant field like math, computer science, etc
- be working toward an advanced degree in one of these fields
- currently work as a data scientist using ML models that you design and train
- be able to read a modern ML paper in your subfield and understand most of it
- have working knowledge of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or MXNet

If you _are_ a beginner and are interested in getting into machine learning at a deep technical level, go for it! There are lots of good introductory courses and textbooks online, such as:
- theoretical
    - Start by reading the [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
    - [This](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) list of major papers in each subfield of machine learning. It hasn't been updated since 2018 but it's still a good resource.
    - A [list of lists](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/Machine-Learning-Tutorials) of deep learning tutorials, articles, and other resources.
- practical
    - [This](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) list of ML-related libraries and frameworks for many programming languages.
    - PyTorch has some good [getting-started tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). They're designed to teach you PyTorch specifically.
    - ScikitLearn is a set of libraries for classificaiton, regression, and clustering. It also includes a widely-used set of pre-processing functionality. Tutorials are [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html).
    
## Where does the hackathon take place?
We are currently exploring options, including:
- A company in Berlin who would lend us their office space for the weekend.
- A house that we would rent for the purpose of the event.
- A co-working space in Berlin which is open on the weekend and would admit non-members.

## What happens to the resulting code?
Probably nothing. The purpose of the hackathon is to explore ideas that none of us have time to work on during our regular lives, not really to build a product. However, anyone who attends the hackathon is free to use any of the resulting code however they want. We'll make it publicly available under the MIT license.

## Sponsors
We are looking for sponsors to cover:
- Renting the space.
- Renting monitors (because coding on a laptop screen all weekend is no fun).
- Some GPUs to train our models. This could be either cloud credits or physical machines.

The legal home for the hackathon is [New Approach Technologies GmbH](newapproachtechnologies.com), an ML freelancing firm run by Nicholas Hoff.
